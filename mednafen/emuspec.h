/* The EmulateSpecStruct POD typedef, factored out of git.h so it can
   be included from plain C translation units.  git.h itself is C++
   (it pulls in <algorithm>, <string>, <vector>, <map>), but
   EmulateSpecStruct is pure POD and several TUs now need it.

   git.h #includes this header in place of its former inline copy,
   so the C++ side sees the identical type.

   Pre-conversion the struct had C++ default member initializers
   (every field defaulted to NULL / 0 / false).  Those are dropped
   here because they're C++-only syntax; only one TU in the tree
   (the libretro entry-point, converted to C in the same commit
   that introduced this header) ever stack-instantiated the struct
   without an explicit initializer, and that call site moved to
   `EmulateSpecStruct spec = {0};` which yields the same zero-init
   semantics. */
